#' rJST: Joint Sentiment Topic modelling for R
#' 
#' rJST performs Joint Sentiment Topic modelling and includes a
#' reversed model (for info on the latter, email me) and several
#' methods to evaluate the results and make them more accessible.
#' All models take \pkg{quanteda} dfm objects as inputs. Furthermore,
#' all models have a defined tidy method. See \pkg{broom} for more
#' information.
